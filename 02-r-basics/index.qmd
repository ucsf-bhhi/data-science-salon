![R for Data Science (via [Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/))](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b88ef926a004b0fce72b2526b0b5c4413666a4cb/24a30/cover.png)

## Coding basics

  * R can be used to do basic math calculations
    * Basic arithmetic on vectors is applied to every element of the vector.
  * In R, new objects can be created with the assignment operator `<-` 
    * RStudioâ€™s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign) to save time.
    * _Note_ the value of `x` in the example below is not printed, just stored, to view it you need to type `x` in the console

## Examples: Basic math and operations on a vector 

```r
2 + 1
x <- 1
y <- c(1, 2, 3, 5)
x + y
```

## Comments

Comments are important and used mainly as a brief description for what the following code does.

  * R will ignore text after a `#` in that line, but the text can still be read by users
  * Some short code is self explanatory and does not require any description
  * Best practice is to explain _why_ code was written rather explaining every single line
    * Code will often get updated, and it can be tedious to update every single comment

## Comments (example)

```r
# Create a vector of even numbers between 1 and 10
even <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
```

## What's in the name

  * Object names must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, and `_` and `.`
  * Object names should be brief and descriptive--it is best to adopt a convention for multiple words, such as `snake_case`
    * **snake_case** is where you separate lowercase words with *_*
  * In R objects can be overwritten over and over

## What's in the name
    
```r
# snake_case
raw_data
clean_data

# overwrite object x
x <- 1
x
x <- 2
x
```

## What's in the name

  * R is character and case sensitive, common error is when an object is not found due to a typo
  
## Example

```r
x <- 1
X
#> Error: object 'X' not found
```

## Calling functions

R has a large collection of built-in functions that work like this: `function_name(argument1 = value1, arguement2 = value2, ...)`

  * For example, `head` has two argument one  `x` where it is expecting a data set as input and the output displays the first 6 rows of the input data.
  * You can specify the input values explictley, e.g., `x = value`, or list the input(s) in the order the function expects each argument.
  * You can learn more about what a function does by typing `?` before the function name in the console

```r
head(x = mtcars)
head(mtcars)
?head
```

## Installing/Using packages

  - You can easily install packages with the `install.packages()` function from base R--which install packages from `CRAN`
    - There is a large body of existing packages to select from in `CRAN`
    - _however_  developmental version of packages are often readily available and can be installed in `Git`
    - To insall packages from `Git` you will need to use functions from the `devtools` package
    
## Installation example

```r
install.packages("dplyr")
```

## Loading libraries

  - Libraries are not automatically loaded into your R environment (by default)
  - You need to use `library()` function to load them in one by one
    


## Data types

In R there are 4 main data types:

  - integer `int`
  - character `chr`
  - factor `fct`
  - numeric `num`
  - list is a combination of the above (we will cover another day)

## Data types

  - In R, both character and factor data types are specified in quotes, whereas integer data and numeric data are specified without quotes.
  - Mathematical operations can only be performed on integer or numeric data.
  - Character data is typically used to store text like features, whereas factor data is intended to have some kind of leveling structure, e.g., `Species` variable in the `iris` data

## Data types

  - When you read data into R, R naively tries to assign each variable a data type
  - Unless otherwise specified, R will usually assign any variable with special characters and/or text to type `chr`
  - Evaluating the data types of your variables after reading it in can help identify potential issues with the data 
  
## Data types

```r
typeof(iris$Species)

str(iris)
```
